# Your Poker Quant Assistant
This application has been made for poker players, who wish to learn more about the statistical side of the game, and want a little assistance of calculation while in-game.
The application calculates the possibility of reaching each hand, while you play the hand.

### Pre-flop
The programme asks you to input your cards in the following format: number of the card, followed by the suit (e.g.: 8s, Tm, As). After the two cards you need to input the number of opponents at the table. The programme will output the chance that someone has a stronger hand than you, and the chance of flopping any combination, such as backdoor flush, straight draw, set, pair etc.

### Flop
The programme asks you to input the flop in a comma separated format (e.g.: 9s,2r,Km). After this the programme will output your hand strenght (high card, pair etc.), and will list your chances of reaching a set, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, royal flush on the turn, and by the river.

### Turn
The programme asks you to input the turn in the same format as the starting cards. After this the programme will output your hand strenght (high card, pair etc.), and will list your chances of reaching a set, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, royal flush on the river.
